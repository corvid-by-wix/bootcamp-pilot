# Week 2 - Verticals and Wix APIs

These weeks labs focus on working with the [Wix Window API](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/wix-window) and [Wix Stores](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/wix-stores-backend). Wix Window enables you to dynamically open and close pages in your site. Wix Stores and other verticals APIs enable you to customize the out-of-the-box features.

## Challenge 1

On the Demo page, open a lightbox that is able to show the name of the plant that was clicked. You will need to pass context from the page to the lightbox using Wix Window.  


## Challenge 2

Enable a cart checkout price minimum. Users should not be able to checkout unless the total value of their cart is greater than $35.
