# Week 2 - Verticals and Wix APIs

These weeks labs focus on working with the [Wix Window API](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/wix-window) and [Wix Users](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/wix-users). Wix Window enables you to dynamically open and close pages in your site. Wix Users enable you to customize the out-of-the-box Wix Member's Area feature.

## Challenge 1

On the Demo page, open a lightbox that is able to show the name of the plant that was clicked. You will need to pass context from the page to the lightbox using Wix Window.  


## Challenge 2

Enable users to create a custom gallery of images that they have uploaded with their plants they've previouly purchased. You will need to create a new collection, building off what you have learned in Week 1.
