# Week 1 - Wix Data

These weeks labs focus on working with the [Wix Data API](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-data) and [Wix Datasets](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-dataset). Wix Data is a powerful tool for creating dynamic experiences on Wix Websites. Let's look at ways to implement display, search, and filter on your sites.

## Challenge 1

On a page with a Repeater, create a custom search experience that enables a user to enter a term and filter down the list of items in a Repeater for the **Plants Collection** to search on the users entry. On Key Press or On Click for Search is OK.

## Challenge 1 BONUS

Add a Reference Field to the **Family Collection** to your **Plants** Database Collection you used in Challenge 1. Add in a Dropdown field to enable filtering on the Family reference field. 

## Challenge 2

Create a user experience where users can filter a list of **Plants** Database Collection using the Selection Tags UI element. As users select or unselect tags, the list should reflect only items that match the selected tags. There is a tag field you can use in the Plant Collection.
