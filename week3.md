# Week 3 - Integrations
This week's lab focuses on working with the [Wix Fetch API](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-fetch/fetch) / [npm](https://www.wix.com/velo/feature/npm-packages). Wix Fetch and npm allows developers to use external webservices. Wix Fetch works just like Javascript's fetch API.

## Challenge 1

On a new page, drag and drop a repeater anywhere you'd like. Using wix-fetch, make a GET request to the following URL: https://joshuaa44.wixsite.com/mysite-34/_functions/list. Make sure to use console.log to test your results. After you've made a successful GET request, display the image and name of the dog on the repeater.

## Challenge 1 BONUS 

Make a GET request to display ONE random dog from the API. You can use npm modules to help as well! 


## Challenge 2

Integrate your web app with [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/client/javascript/quickstart)! Install the [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twilio) from the backend tab. Use text input UI elements for the recipientâ€™s phone number and the message text.



### HINT
Use the API reference!
